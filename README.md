# Giftaway

A little bit of context: This is made to be used with Nookazon, a game-trading platform.

This website is a tool to help the administrators to run giveaways.

With this tool, your can see who gave an item, who won an item, who has been contacted, etc,…

It helps them for intern organization.

The project also contains the ability to make forms to collect informations the easiest way about players.

*(You can see the finish project here.)*

## **Who did what ?**

-   Vitto : The calendar page, the colors and the responsive — Frontend

-   Lauranne: The colors, the responsive, the header, the footer, the logo, the forms, the readme, the powerpoint — Frontend
-   Luna: The calendar
-   Céline: The colors, the global vision, the idea

## **Why ?**

Céline needed a tool to help her in her job, so Valentin had the idea of creating this project.

We are currently thinking about extending this as a global giveaway tool, full open-source.

## **Which languages were used?**

Inertia, Tailwind, React, JS, Laravel, Google App Scripts.

## **What was the easiest part ?**

-   Vitto : The team was nice to work with, and even if I didn’t find
-   Valentin : The team was nice to work with, and I loved working with Laravel (lots of functionalities, components to discover and understand, so overall it was very interesting)
-   Lauranne : Design. It was fun to do, execution was simple. The team knew what they wanted so it was nice working with them.

## **What was the hardest part ?**

-   Vitto : Find a good balance between aesthetic and functional at the first try. I’ve lost lots on time on this part.
-   Valentin : Keeping the team informed of the updates I was doing, and delegate the work.
-   Lauranne : Split the work with another front-end. It’s not a problem for me to work with someone else but it’s hard to delegate.
